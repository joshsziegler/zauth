# BUGFIX

- Times seem to be reported incorrectly... reported as UTC, when actually EST?
- task build not building when certain go files change?
- The "Ballot Box with a Checkmark" Emoji ( U+1F5F9 ) used to show group membership doesn't appear to be supported by Ubuntu?  

# TODO
- File Sharing
  - Upload files to correct upload/share directory
  - Save uploaded files in the DB
  - Link to a Group's files when they click on the link
  - Show group members and files when clicked
- Require Group for Git Login
- Config options for: Full domain/URL, Website Name, Reply Email, Email Name, ...
- Allow admins to SEND a password reset link to a given user? Or put on page?
- Deactivate Accounts With LastLogin > 90 Days Ago
  Send the deactivated users an email before it happens? (30 days before)
  	mysql zauth -e "SELECT FirstName, LastName, LastLogin FROM Users WHERE LastLogin < (CURDATE() - INTERVAL 60 DAY)";

- Disable Shared Accounts
	UPDATE Users 
	SET Disabled=1 
	WHERE FirstName IN ('Test', 'Map User 1', 'Map User 2', 'Map User 3', 'SVN', 'LDAP', 'Test', 'Synthetic Teammate', 'Demo', 'BOINC User', 'Air Force User', 'Redmine Account');
